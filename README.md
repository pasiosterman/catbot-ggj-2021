# Catbot-ggj-2021

Game for the Global Game Jam Online and Finnish Game jam 2021. It's a game where you control a robot whose job is to collect all the escaped cats back to their dropzone. To help you do this you can find multiple different modules that help you get around and view the gameworld from different perspectives like overhead view, first-person view. 

Character can be moved around using **WASD** and rotated with **QE** or **Mouse**. Picking up cats can be done with **F-key** or **Left Mouse Button**. Jumping can be done with **spacebar**. You can also move a bit faster while holding the shift key.
